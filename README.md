# Protanopia

Protanopia is an inability to see the red colour due to the absence of the red retina photoreceptors. It is genetic and affects much more often men than women. The goal of this app is to show how people with protanopia see the world. It was written with Kivy, Pillow and OpenCv libraries.

There are two versions of the app:
1. Laptop version (for windows) - it allows user to upload a photo from a device, then changes it colours to show how a person with protanopia would probably see it and save it in the folder from which it was uploaded as a new file. Another functionality is a camera which applies a protanopia filter in real time.
2. Android version - it allows only to upload photos from a device and change them to the colours which person with protanopia sees.
